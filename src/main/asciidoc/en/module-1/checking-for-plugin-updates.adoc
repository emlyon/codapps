The Codename One plugin is the tool that enables us to apps with NetBeans.

You have installed the plugin, but the creators of the plugin continue to make it evolve, adding new functionalities to it.

//ST: !
It is important to have the latest version of the plugin installed.

When you open NetBeans, it actually checks for you if there is any update available:

//ST: !
If there is a notification, it means updates are available. Click on the bubble and follow the instructions to download and install the updates.

//ST: !
You can have updates for the Codename One plugin, but also for other components of NetBeans you are not familiar with.

I advise you to install all the updates available.

== 2. Propagating the update to existing projects

Now, what if you already had created an app in NetBeans? *It will not automatically benefit from the updated plugin*.

Follow these steps:

//ST: !
a.	Right click on the project‚Äôs name, select 'Properties'
b.	In the window that opens, click on ‚ÄúUpdate project libs‚Äù. Close the window
c.	Right click again on the project‚Äôs name. Click on ‚ÄúClean and Build‚Äù. You should be good to go!

== 3. Rare case: the check for updates fails
//ST: 3. Rare case: the check for updates fails

//ST: !
It sometimes happens that the address that NetBeans checks for plugin updates is incorrect.

In this case, NetBeans will never find updates and you‚Äôll be stuck with an old version of the plugin!

Here is how to make sure you have everything correctly setup (explanations follow the picture below)

//ST: !
- In the NetBeans menu, click on Tools -> Plugin
- In the window that opens, click on tab ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù (last tab on the right)
** Select the line ‚ÄúCodenameOnePlugin Update Center‚Äù, it should be highlighted
** Verify that the url (web address) on the right is:
`https://www.codenameone.com/files/netbeans/updates.xml`

//ST: !
** If it‚Äôs not, then click on ‚Äúedit‚Äù and put this address above instead.
** By default, updates are checked every week. Change this for ‚Äúevery startup‚Äù.

//ST: !
That‚Äôs it! You have to do it just once, next time NetBeans will now how to search plugin updates by itself! üéâ

Just check if there is a bubble at the bottom right corner when you open NetBeans.
