== 1. Some preparations
//ST: 1. Some preparations

//ST: !
Not sure what a Form is? Have a look at the previous lessons!

To start this lesson, we will assume that you already created a Form called "Form1" and that you opened it in the GUI Builder, like this:

//ST: !
image::Opening-the-Form-we-created-to-work-on-it.png[align="center",title="Opening the Form we created to work on it"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
So that you should now have the GUI Builder open to design your Form. Here is a recall of the different panels that compose the GUI Builder:

{nbsp} +


== 2. Adding a Label to your Form
//ST: 2. Adding a Label to your Form

//ST: !
==== a. A piece of text is called a *Label*. Why?

//ST: !
As mentioned in a previous lesson, in coding and software development, things don't have intuitive names:

- For example, a "screen" is called a Form (we have explained this one before).
- Another example: every element to be put on the Form is going to be called a *"Component"*, so make sure you memorize this.

And a Component that shows some text is going to be called... a *Label*. Not "Text". Why?

//ST: !
*Simply because calling it "Text" would be misleading*. When you show some text on screen there is the text itself, *but also its size, color, id, etc*.

-> so *"Label"* is more accurate: a *Label* is made of a piece of text *and* a color, a size, some decorations (maybe bold? italic?), etc.

With these explanations and clarifications made, we can now add a Label in our app!

//ST: !
==== b. Concrete steps to add a Label to the Form

//ST: !
Start by opening the 'Core Components' menu on the top right:

//ST: !
image::Opening-the-Core-Components-menu.png[align="center",title="Opening the Core Components menu"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
Then *drag and drop a Label onto the Form*. Place it where you prefer:

//ST: !
image::Drag---dropping-a-Label.png[align="center",title="Drag - dropping a Label"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
==== c. Label or Span Label?

//ST: !
You may have noticed that a Component called "Span Label" also exists, right next to Label:

//ST: !
image::A-Span-Label.png[align="center",title="A Span Label"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
Span Labels are like regular Labels, *but their text can stretch on many lines*, not just one. Even if this is a tiny difference, you have cases when one is more practical than the other.


== 3. Adding a Button to your Form - and your first Action!
//ST: 3. Adding a Button to your Form - and your first Action!

//ST: !
==== a. Adding the button

//ST: !
Adding a Button is easy: just like we did for Labels, *we just need to drag and drop the Button* onto the Form:

//ST: !
image::Drag---dropping-a-Button.png[align="center",title="Drag - dropping a Button"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
==== b. Making the button do something

//ST: !
Of course the button, alone, is not interesting: it should do something when the user of the app touches it.

You can launch the preview of your app (big green arrow image:green-arrow.jpg[] in the NetBeans menu): you see in the preview that the button can be pressed, but nothing happens. *We need to attach an Action to the button*.

//ST: !
Actions can be very complex: for example, a gaming app has buttons making characters jump or run. Or a store app has buttons that select products and make payments...

-> *All these actions happen through lines of code that need to be written*.

//ST: !
We are going to create a very simple action to illustrate the principle: *pressing the button will change the text of the Label*

//ST: !
==== c. Step-by-step creation of an action attached to the button

//ST: !
[WARNING]
====
*This is not completely stable. If the creation of the action does not work well:*

- Delete your button and create a new one
- Follow the steps carefully, without taking shortcuts
- Only if you have tried several times and things still don't work, then you can report https://github.com/seinecle/codapps/issues[an issue here].
====


//ST: !
*1.* Make sure you have a Label on the Form - since we want to change its text with the Button!

(you should have one as we created one, above in this lesson).

//ST: !
[start=2]
*2.* Select the button with your mouse and click on the three dots in the properties:

//ST: !
image::Selecting-the-Button.png[align="center",title="Selecting the Button"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
This opens a new window.

//ST: !
[start=3]
*3.* Give a name to the action and to the button

//ST: !
image::Giving-a-name-to-the-action-and-to-the-button.png[align="center",title="Giving a name to the action and to the button"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
[NOTE]
====
You might have the idea to add a picture to your button, because you see properties named "icon" or "Pick Image".

Actually, the best way to add a picture to a button is to use a "Scaled Button", not a Button. We explain how to do in the lesson on "Adding Pictures" in this module.
====

//ST: !
[start=4]
*4.* The GUI Builder should have switched automatically back to NetBeans (don't worry the GUI Builder has not been closed)

- The lines of code for an action have been automatically written in the file of your Form, which is called "Form1.java" if your Form is named Form1.
- These lines of code should look like:

//ST: !
.Form1.java
[source,java]
----
//-- DON'T EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE!!!
public void onUpdateLabelTextCommand(com.codename1.ui.events.ActionEvent ev, com.codename1.ui.Command cmd) { // <1>

} //<2>
----
<1> This line is complicated but you can notice that the name of our Action appears in it ("UpdateLabelText").
Notice also the *opening curly brace* at the end of the line: *{*
<2> This is a *closing curly brace*.

//ST: !
Everything you write between the opening curly brace *{* and the closing curly brace *}* will be performed when the user touches the button.

So let's write the instruction to change the text of the Label!

//ST: !
We are going to write just one line of code between the curly braces:

//ST: !
[source,java]
----
this.gui_Label.setText("pressed!");
----

//ST: !
[NOTE]
====
Here we suppose that the Label that you want impact with your Button is called "Label".
Check the name of your Label in the GUI Builder: if it is named `Label_1` or `Label_2`, then the line of code should become:

`this.gui_Label_1.setText("pressed!");` or `this.gui_Label_2.setText("pressed!");`
====

So that it looks like:

//ST: !
[[anchor-set-text-label-in-code]]
.Form1.java
[source,java]
----
//-- DON'T EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE!!!
public void onUpdateLabelTextCommand(com.codename1.ui.events.ActionEvent ev, com.codename1.ui.Command cmd) {
      this.gui_Label.setText("pressed!"); // <1>
}

----
<1> the line we added between the curly braces.

//ST: !
You can now preview your app (big green arrow in NetBeans). Press the button in the preview, the effect should be:

//ST: !
image::Previewing-the-button-and-its-action.png[align="center",title="Previewing the button and its action"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
Not this result? Make sure you save the GUI Builder! (File -> Save)

//ST: !
Congratulations! You learned how to place a Label on screen, a Button, and how to make the Button perform an action. This is a huge step! üéâüéâüéâ

//ST: !
In the next lesson of this module, we are going to learn how to insert a picture in the app.
