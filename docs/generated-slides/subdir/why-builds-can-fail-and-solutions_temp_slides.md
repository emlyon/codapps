==  1. Builds failing in NetBeans

==  !

==  2. Builds failing on the Codename One website

==  !
When you sent your build successfully from NetBeans, it arrives on Codename One servers. There, it gets transformed into an Android app or an iPhone app, depending on what you requested.

==  !
A number of reasons can make your build terminate with an error at this stage.

==  !
Login to www.codenameone.com, go on the dashboard and check the status of your build:

==  !
As you see, the build of this Android app failed. What happened?

To do a diagnostic, click on the *date and time* on the red display and then click on "Error log" to open the error message:

The text that appears is typically very long and intimidating. The good news is, we are usually *just interested in the lines at the bottom*.

*Scroll down to the bottom.*

Your builds might have failed for a number of reasons. Here are common causes:

==  !
==== a. Error due to bad password / certificate in Android build

==  !
The last lines of an error log can look like:

==  !
 Caused by: java.io.IOException: Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect
 at com.android.ide.common.signing.KeystoreHelper.getCertificateInfo(KeystoreHelper.java:177)
 ... 78 more
 Caused by: java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: Password verification failed
 ... 79 more

==  !
 BUILD FAILED

==  !
 Total time: 46.953 secs
 Stopped 0 compiler daemon(s).

==  !
Can you spot the error? It is mentioned before "Build Failed":

 Caused by: java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: Password verification failed

Apparently, there is a problem with the password of my certificate.

==  !
This error typically happens when you tried *multiple times* to create a certificate for your app.

==  !
The solution is simple:

1. Open the Codename One properties of the project:

==  !

==  !
[start=2]
2. Go to the Android properties and take the name and location of the "keystore.ks" file indicated here:

==  !
[.stretch]
image::Find-this-file-on-your-computer-and-delete-it.png[align="center",title="Find this file on your computer and delete it"]


==  !
[start="3]
3. Now, redo the steps of creating a certificate for Android apps, in the lesson of this module.

Because you just deleted the "keystore.ks" file, you will start from a clean state and your password issues should be solved.

==  3. Still stuck with a failed build?
